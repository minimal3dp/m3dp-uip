1. Not Extruding at Start of Print
This issue is very common for new 3D printer owners, but thankfully, it is also
very easy to resolve. There are four possible causes if your extruder does not
extrude plastic at the beginning of your print. We will walk through each one
below and explain how to solve the problem.
1.1 Filament was not loaded into extruder before printing
Most extruders have a problem of leaking plastic when they keep still at a
high temperature. The hot plastic inside the nozzle tends to ooze out of the tip,
which creates a void inside the nozzle where the plastic has drained out. This
idle oozing can occur at the beginning of a print when you are first preheating
your extruder, and also at the end of the print while the extruder is slowly cooling.
If your extruder has lost some plastic due to oozing, the next time you try to
extrude, it will take a few seconds before plastic starts to come out of the nozzle
again. If you are trying to start a print after you nozzle has been oozing, you may
notice the same delayed extrusion.
To solve this issue, make sure that you prime your extruder right before
beginning a print so that the nozzle is full of plastic and ready to extrude. A
common way to do this in Cura is by including something called a skirt. The skirt
will draw a circle around your part, and in the process, it will prime the extruder
with plastic.


---


## Page 10


5
If you need extra priming, you can increase the number of skirt outlines on
the Expert tab in Cura. You can also use control knob in 3D printer to extrude
plastic before printing.
1.2 The distance between nozzle and bed is too close
If the nozzle is too close to the bed, there will not be enough room for plastic
to come out of the extruder. The hole in the top of the nozzle is essentially blocked
so that no plastic can come out. An easy way to recognize this issue is if the print
does not extrude plastic for the first layer or two, but begins to extrude normally
around the 3rd or 4th layers. To solve this problem, you can adjust the four screws
at the corners of the hot bed, turn the screws clockwise and the hot bed will move
down. Turn a little once to increase the distance until there is enough space for
plastic extrusion (The distance is about the thickness of a piece of A4 Paper ).
1.3 The filament stripped against the drive gear
3D printers use a small gear to push the filament back and forth. The teeth on
this gear bite into the filament and allow it to accurately control the position of the
filament. However, if you notice lots of plastic shavings or it looks like there is a
section missing from your filament, then it’s possible that the drive gear has removed
too much plastic. Once this happens, the drive gear won’t have anything left to grab
onto when it tries to move the filament back and forth. Please see the Grinding
Filament section for instructions on how to fix this issue.

1.4 The extruder is clogged
If none of the above suggestions are able to resolve the issue, then it is likely
that your extruder is clogged. This can happen if foreign debris is trapped inside
the nozzle, when hot plastic sits inside the extruder too long, or if the thermal
cooling for the extruder is not sufficient and the filament begins to soften outside of
the desired melt zone. We successfully used relative diameter drill (or relative
diameter copper line of electric wire) to unclog extruders by feeding it into the nozzle
tip. You need to heat the extruder to 200 ℃ when you do this. Attention not hurt by
the hot extruder. Please contact your printer manufacturer if you need disassemble
the extruder.

2. Print Not Sticking to the Bed
It is very important that the first layer of your print is strongly connected to
the printer’s build platform so that the remainder of your part can be built on this
foundation. If the first layer is not sticking to the build platform, it will create


---


## Page 13

problems later on. There are many different ways to cope with these first layer
adhesion problems, so we will examine several typical causes below and explain
how to address each one.
2.1 Build platform is not level
3D printer uses 4 screws to control the position of the bed. If you have trouble
to get your first layer to stick to the bed, the first thing you need to verify is that
your printer’s bed is flat and level. If the bed is not level, one side of your bed
may be too close to the nozzle, while the other side is too far away. Achieving a
perfect first layer requires a level print bed. 3D printer already has a useful bed
leveling video that guide you through the bed leveling process.
You can find this video by visiting website www.3d.com to Download Center and
download the video or watch online.
2.2 Nizzle starts too far away from the bed
Once your bed has been properly leveled, you still need to make sure that
the nozzle is starting at the correct height relative to the build platform. Your goal
is to locate your extruder the perfect distance away from the build plate — not
too far and not too close. For good adhesion to the build plate, you want your
filament to be slightly adhesive against the build plate. You can adjust the four
screws at the corners of the hot bed, turn the screws anticlockwise and the hot
bed will move up. Turn a little once to reduce the distance until there is suitable
room for filament extrusion(The distance is about the thickness of a piece of A4


---

paper). Be careful to only make small adjustments to this setting. Each layer of
your part is usually only around 0.2mm thick, so a small adjustment goes a long
way.
2.3 First layer is printing too fast
As you extrude the first layer of plastic, you want the plastic can properly
bond to the surface of build platform before starting the next layer. If you print the
first layer too fast, the plastic may not have time to bond to the build platform. For
this reason, it is typically very useful to print the first layer at a slower speed so
that the plastic has time to bond to the bed. Cura provides a setting for this exact
feature. If you click on “Advanced” and go to the Speed tab, you will see a setting
labeled “Bottom Layer Speed”. For example, if you set a first layer speed of 20,
it means that your first layer will print 20mm/s. If you feel that your printer is
moving too fast on the first layer, try reducing this setting.
2.4 Temperature or cooling settings
Plastic tends to shrink when its temperature is down. To provide a useful
example, imagine a 100mm wide part that is being printed with ABS plastic. If the
extruder was printing this plastic at 230 degrees Celsius, but it was being
deposited onto a cold build platform, it is likely that the plastic would quickly cool
down after leaving the hot nozzle. 3D printer also includes cooling fans that speed
up this cooling process when they are being used. If this ABS part cooled down
to a room temperature of 30℃, the 100mm wide part would shrink by almost
1.5mm.Unfortunately, the build platform on your printer is not going to shrink this


---


## Page 15


10
much, since it is typically kept at a fairly constant temperature. Because of this
fact, the plastic will tend to separate from the build platform as it cools. This is an
important fact to keep in mind as you print your first layer. If you notice that the
layer seems to stick initially, but later separates from the print bed as it cools, it
is possible that your temperature and cooling settings are to blame.
In order to print high-temperature materials like ABS, 3D printer includes a
heated bed to help combat these problems. If the bed it heated to maintain a
temperature of 70-100℃ for the entire print, it will keep the first layer warm so that
it does not shrink. As a general starting point, PLA tends to adhere well to a bed
that is heated to 40-6℃, while ABS generally works better if the bed is heated to
70-100℃. You can adjust these settings by the control panel. The specific setting
process: Press the knob to enter the menu, and go to the Control tab, confirm,
then go to the Bed tab, confirm, then turn the knob to adjust the temperature.
You may also want to try disabling that cooling fan for the first few layers of your
printer so that the initial layers do not cool down too quickly. You can
read “Cura Tutorial” to learn how to resolve this issue.
If you are using ABS plastic, it is common to disable the cooling fan for the
entire print. If you are working in a breezy environment, you may also want to try
to insulate your printer to keep the wind away from your part.

2.5 The build platform (tape, glues and materials)
Different plastics tend to adhere better to different materials. If you are going
to print directly onto these surfaces, it is always a good idea to make sure that
your build platform is free of dust, grease, or oils before starting the print.
Cleaning your print bed with some water or isopropyl rubbing alcohol can make
a big difference. There are several types of tape that stick well to common 3D
printing materials. Strips of tape can be applied to the build platform surface and
easily removed or replaced if you want to print with a different material. For
example, PLA tends to stick well to blue painter’s tape while ABS tends to stick
better to Kapton tape (otherwise known as Polyimide film). You can use
temporary glue or spray on the top of their build platforms. Hair spray, glue sticks,
and other sticky substances tend to work very well if everything else has failed.
Feel free to experiment to see what works best for you!
2.6 When all else fails: Brims and Rafts
Sometimes you are printing a very small part that simply does not have
enough surface area to stick to the build platform surface. Cura includes several
options that can help increase this surface area to provide a larger surface to stick
to the print bed. One of these options is called a “brim.” The brim adds extra rings
around the exterior of your part, similar to how a brim of a hat increases the
circumference of the hat. This option can be enabled by going to the “Support” tab
end enabling the “Platform adhesion type” option. Cura also allows users to add


---


## Page 17


12
a raft under their part, which can also be used to provide a larger surface for bed
adhesion. If you are interested in these options, please take a look at
“Cura Tutorial”, which explains things in greater detail.

3. Not Extruding Enough Plastic
Cura includes some settings used to determine how much plastic the 3D printer
should extruder. However, because the 3D printer does not provide any feedback
about how much plastic actually leaves the nozzle, it’s possible that there may be
less plastic exiting the nozzle than what the software expects (otherwise known as
under-extrusion). If this happens, you may start to notice gaps between adjacent
extrusions of each layer. The most reliable way to test whether or not your printer is
extruding enough plastic is to print a simple 20mm tall cube with at least 3 perimeter
outlines. At the top of the cube, check and see whether the 3 perimeters are strongly
bonded together or not. If there are gaps between the 3 perimeters, then you are
under-extruding. If the 3 perimeters are touching and do not have any gaps, then you
are likely encountering a different issue. If you determine that you are underextruding,
there are several possible causes for this, which we have summarized below.
3.1 Incorrect filament diameter
The first thing you need to verify is that the software knows the filament
diameter that you are using. You can find this setting by clicking “Basic” and going
to the “Filament” tab. Check to make sure that this value matches the filament
that you purchased. You may even want to measure your filament yourself using
a pair of calipers to make sure that you truly have the correct diameter specified
in the software. The most common values for the filament diameter are 1.75mm
and 2.85mm. The diameter of 3D printer filament is


---


## Page 19


14
1.75mm.
3.2 Increase the extrusion speed
If your filament diameter is correct, but you are still seeing under-extrusion
issues, then you need to adjust your extrusion speed. This is a very useful setting
in 3D printer control panel that allows you to easily modify the amount of plastic
that is extruded (otherwise known as the flow rate). You can find this setting by
turning the knob to enter “Configuration” .Specific setting process as follows:
Press the knob to enter the menu, choose “Configuration”, confirm， turn to
“motion”, confirm, find “Esteps/mm” tab, turn the knob to adjust extrusion speed.
The default value is 95mm/s, you can change it to 97mm/s. that means the plastic
will be extruded more 2mm/s than before. Try increasing your extrusion speed
and then reprint the test cube to see if you still have gaps between your
perimeters. Notice that increasing a little once to avoid extruding too much plastic.

4. Extruding Too Much Plastic
The software is constantly working together with your printer to make sure  that
your nozzle is extruding the correct amount of plastic. This precise extrusion is
an important factor in achieving good print quality. However, most 3D printers
have no way of monitoring how much plastic is actually extruded. If your extrusion


---


## Page 21


16
settings are not configured properly, the printer may extruder more plastic than
the software expects. This over-extrusion will result in excess plastic that can ruin
the outer dimensions of your part. To resolve this issue, there are only a few
settings you need to verify in 3D control panel. Please see the Not Extruding
Enough Plastic section for a more detailed description. While those instructions
are for under-extrusion, you will adjust the same settings for over-extrusion, just
in the opposite direction. For example, if increasing the extrusion speed helps
with under-extrusion, then you should decrease the
extrusion speed for over-extrusion issues.

5. Holes and Gaps in the Top Layers
To save plastic, most 3D printed parts are created to have a solid shell that
surrounds a porous, partially hollow interior. For example, the interior of the part
may use a 30% infill percentage, which means that only 30% of the interior is


---


## Page 23


18
solid plastic, while the rest is air. While the interior of the part may be partially
hollow, we want the exterior to remain solid. To do this, 3D allows you to specify
how many solid layers you want on the top and bottom of your part. For example,
if you were printing a simple cube with 5 top and bottom solid layers, the software
would print 5 completely solid layers at the top and bottom of the print, but
everything else in the middle would be printed as a partially hollow layer. This
technique can save a tremendous amount of plastic and time, while still creating
very strong parts. However, depending on what settings you are using, you may
notice that the top solid layers of your print are not completely solid. You may see
gaps or holes between the extrusions that make up these solid layers. If you have
encountered this issue, here are several simple settings that you can adjust to fix
it.
5.1 Not enough top solid layers
The first setting to adjust is the number of top solid layers. When you try to
print a 100% solid layer on top of your partially hollow infill, the solid layer has to
span across the hollow air pockets of your infill. When this happens, the
extrusions for the solid layer have a tendency to droop or sag down into the air
pocket. Because of this, you generally want to print several solid layers at the top
of your print to ensure a nice flat, completely solid surface. As a good rule of
thumb, you want the solid section at the top of your print to be at least 0.6mm
thick. So if you are using a 0.2mm layer height, you would need at least 3 top
solid layers. If you are printing at a lower layer height such as 0.1mm, you may
need 6 solid layers at the top of your print to achieve the same effect. If you are
noticing gaps between the extrusions in your top surface, the first thing you


---


## Page 24


19
should try is increasing the number of top solid layers. For example, if you noticed
the problem using only 0.6mm solid layers, try printing with 1mm solid layers to
see if the problem is improved. Note that additional solid layers will occur within
your part dimension and do not add size to the exterior of your part.
You can adjust the solid layer settings by clicking “Basic” and selecting the
Bottom/Top Thickness tab.
5.2 Infill percentage is too low
The infill on the inside of your part will act as the foundation for the layers above it.
The top solid layers of your part will need to print on top of this foundation. If you
infill percentage is very low, there will be large air gaps in your infill. For example, if
you using an infill percentage of only 10%, the remaining 90% of the interior of your
part would be hollow, and this would create some very large air gaps that the solid
layers would need to print on top of. If you have tried increasing the number of top
solid layers and you are still seeing gaps in the top of your print, you may want to
try increasing your infill percentage to see if the gaps go away. For example, if your
infill percentage was previously 10%, try using a 30% infill percentage, as this
would provide a much better foundation for the solid layers at the top of your print.
5.3 Under-extrusion
If you have tried increasing the infill percentage and the number of top solid
layers, yet you are still seeing gaps in the tops of your print, then you likely have
an under-extrusion issue. This means that your nozzle is not extruding as much
plastic as the software expects. For a full description of this issue and how to
correct it, please read the Not Extruding Enough Plastic section.

6. Stringing or Oozing
Stringing (otherwise known as oozing, whiskers, or “hairy” prints) occurs
when small strings of plastic are left behind on a 3D printed model. This is
typically due to plastic oozing out of the nozzle while the extruder is moving to a


---


## Page 26


21
new location. Thankfully, there are several settings in Cura can help with this
issue. The most common setting that is used to combat excessive stringing is
something that is known as retraction. If retraction is enabled, when the extruder
is done printing one section of your model, the filament will be pulled backwards
into the nozzle to act as a countermeasure against oozing. When it is time to
begin printing again, the filament will be pushed back into the nozzle so that
plastic once again begins extruding from the tip. To ensure retraction is enabled,
click “Basic” and click on the Quality tab. Ensure that the retraction option is
enabled for your extruder. In the sections below, we will discuss the important
retraction settings as well as several other settings that can be used to combat
stringing, such as the extruder temperature settings.
6.1 Retraction distance
The most important retraction setting is the retraction distance. This
determines how much plastic is pulled out of the nozzle. In Cura, you can click
“Advanced” and click Retraction tab to set retraction distance. In general, the
more plastic that is retracted from the nozzle, the less likely the nozzle is to ooze
while moving. Most direct-drive extruders only require a retraction distance of 3.5
mm. If you encounter stringing with your prints, try increasing the retraction
distance by 0.5mm every time and test again to see if the performance improves.


---


## Page 27


22
6.2 Retraction speed
Retraction speed determines how fast the filament is retracted from the
nozzle. If you retract too slowly, the plastic will slowly ooze down through the
nozzle and may start leaking before the extruder is done moving to its new
destination. If you retract too quickly, the filament may separate from the hot
plastic inside the nozzle, or the quick movement of the drive gear may even grind
away pieces of your filament. There is usually a sweet spot somewhere between
30-50 mm/s where retraction performs best. Cura has already provided many
pre-configured profiles that can give you a starting point for what retraction speed
works best, but the ideal value can vary depending on the material that you are
using, so you may want to experiment to see if different speeds decrease the
amount of stringing that you see.
6.3 Temperature is too high
The next most common cause for excessive stringing is the extruder
temperature. If the temperature is too high, the plastic inside the nozzle will
become extremely viscous and will leak out of the nozzle much more easily.
However, if the temperature is too low, the plastic will still be somewhat solid and
will have difficulty extruding from the nozzle. If you feel you have the correct
retraction settings, but you are still encountering these issues, try decreasing
your extruder temperature by 5-10 degrees. This can have a significant impact
on the final print quality. You can adjust these settings through 3D control panel
by turning the knob. First press the knob to enter the menu, choose “Control”,


---


## Page 28


23
confirm and choose “Nozzle”, confirm. Then turn the knob to adjust the
temperature.


---


## Page 29


24
7. Overheating
The plastic that exits your extruder may be anywhere from 190 to 240
degrees Celsius. While the plastic is still hot, it is pliable and can easily be formed
into different shapes. However, as it cools, it quickly becomes solid and retains
its shape. You need to achieve the correct balance between temperature and
cooling so that your plastic can flow freely through the nozzle, but it can quickly
solidify to maintain the exact dimensions of your 3D printed part. If this balance
is not achieved, you may start to notice some print quality issues where the
exterior of your part is not as precise and defined as you would like. As you can
see in the image above, the filament extruded at the top of the pyramid was not
able to cool quickly enough to retain its shape. The section below will examine
several common causes for overheating and how to prevent them.
7.1 Insufficient cooling
The most common cause for overheating is that the plastic is not being
cooled fast enough. When this happens, the hot plastic is free to change shapes
as it slowly cools. For many plastics, it is much better to quickly cool the layers
to prevent them from changing shape after being printed. 3D printer includes a
cooling fan, try increasing the power of the fan to cool the plastic faster. Please
read “Cura Tutorial” to learn how to increase fan’s power


---


## Page 30


25
7.2 Print at too high temperature
If you are already using a cooling fan and you are still seeing this issue, you
may need to try printing at a lower temperature. If the plastic is extruded at a
lower temperature it will be able to solidify faster and retain its shape. Try lowering
the print temperature by 5-10 degrees to see if it helps. Please read “Cura Tutorial”
to learn how to set the temperature. Be careful not to lower the temperature too
far, as otherwise the plastic may not be hot enough to extrude through the small
opening in your nozzle.
7.3 Printing too fast
If you print each layer very quickly, you might not need enough time for the
previous layer to properly cool before you try to deposit the next layer on top of
it. This is particularly important for very small parts where each layer only requires
a few seconds to print. Even with a cooling fan, you may still need to decrease
the printing speed for these small layers to ensure you provide enough time for
the layer to solidify. Cura includes a very simple option to do exactly that. Click
“Advanced” and you will see “Minimal layer time” under “Cool” tab. This section
is used to automatically slow down the printing speed for small layers to ensure
they have enough time to cool and solidify before printing the next layer. For
example, if you allow the software to adjust the printing speed for layers that take
not less than 10 seconds to print, the program will automatically slow down the
printing speed for these small layers.
This is a vital feature for combating these overheating issues.

7.4 When all above fall, try to print multiple parts at once
If you have already tried the 3 items above and you are still having trouble
achieving sufficient cooling, there’s one more thing you can try. You can create a
copy of the part you are trying to print in Cura by selecting model, (Select the
model > Right clicking > Multiply object) or import a second object that can be
printed at the same time. By printing two objects at once, you can provide more
cooling time for each individual part. The hot nozzle will need to move to a
different location on the build platform to print the second part, which provides a
short relief for your first part to cool down. This is a simple, yet very effective
strategy for fixing overheating problems.

8. Layer Shifting or Misalignment
 Most 3D printers use an open-loop control system, which is a fancy way to
say that they have no feedback about the actual location of the nozzle. The printer
simply attempts to move the nozzle to a specific location, and hopes that it gets


---


## Page 33


28
there. In most cases, this works fine because the stepper motors that drive the
printer are quite powerful, and there are no significant loads to prevent the nozzle
from moving. However, if something does go wrong, the printer would have no
way to detect this. For example, if you happened to bump into your printer while
it was printing, you might cause the nozzle to move to a new position. The
machine has no feedback to detect this, so it would just keep printing as if nothing
had happened. If you notice misaligned layers in your print, it is usually due to
one of the causes below. Unfortunately, once these errors occur, the printer has
no way to detect and fix the problem, so we will explain how to resolve these
issues below.。
8.1 Nozzle moves too fast
If you are printing at a very high speed, the motors for your 3D printer may
struggle to keep up. If you attempt to move the printer faster than the motors can
handle, you will typically hear a clicking sound as the motor fails to achieve the
desired position. If this happens, the remainder of the print will be misaligned with
everything that was printed before it. If you feel that your printer may be moving
too fast, try to reduce the printing speed to see if it helps. You can turn the knob
on the control panel of 3D printer to reduce print speed.


---


## Page 34


29
8.2 Mechanical or Electrical issues
If the layer misalignment continues, even after reducing your print speed,
then it is likely due to mechanical or electrical issues with the printer. For example,
most 3D printers use belts that allow the motors to control the position of the
nozzle. The belts are typically made of a rubber material and reinforced with
some steel wire to provide additional strength. Over time, these belts may stretch,
which can impact the belt tension that is used to position the nozzle. If the tension
becomes too loose, the belt may slip on top of the drive pulley, which means the
pulley is rotating, but the belt is not moving. If the belt was originally installed too
tight, this can also cause issues. An overtightened belt can create excess friction
in the bearings that will prevent the motors from spinning. Ideal assembly
requires a belt that is somewhat tight to prevent slipping, but not too tight to where
the system is unable to rotate. If you start noticing issues with misaligned layers,
you should verify that your belts all have the appropriate tension, and none
appear to be too loose or too tight. If you think there may be a problem, please
consult the printer manufacturer for instructions on how to adjust the belt tension.

Many 3D printers also include a series of belts that are driven by pulleys
attached to a stepper motor shaft using a small set-screw (otherwise known as a
grub screw). These set-screws anchor the pulley to the shaft of the motor so that
the two items spin together. However, if the set-screw loosens, the pulley will no
longer rotate together with the motor shaft. This means that the motor may be
spinning, but the pulley and belts are not moving. When this happens, the nozzle
does not get to the desired location, which can impact the alignment of all future


---


## Page 35


30
layers of the print. So if layer misalignment is a reoccurring problem, you should
verify that all of the motor fasteners are properly tightened.

There are also several other common electrical issues that can cause the
motors to lose their position. For example, if there is not enough electrical current
getting to the motors, they won’t have enough power to spin. It is also possible
that the motor driver electronics could overheat, which causes the motors to stop
spinning temporarily until the electronics cool down. While this is not an
exhaustive list, it provides a few ideas for common electrical and mechanical
causes that you may want to check if layer shifting is a persistent problem.

9. Layer Separation and Splitting
3D printing works by building the object one layer at a time. Each successive
layer is printed on top of the previous layer, and in the end this creates the desired
3D shape. However, for the final part to be strong and reliable, you need to make


---


## Page 37


32
sure that each layer adequately bonds to the layer below it. If the layers do not
bond together well enough, the final part may split or separate. We will examine
several typical causes for this below and provide suggestions for resolving each
one.
9.1 Layer height is too large
Most 3D printing nozzles have a diameter between 0.3-0.5mm. The plastic
squeezes through this tiny opening to create a very thin extrusion that can
produce extremely detailed parts. However, these small nozzles also create
some limitations for what layer heights can be used. When you print one layer of
plastic on top of another, you need to make sure that the new layer is being
pressed against the layer below it so that the two layers will bond together. As a
general rule of thumb, you need to make sure that the layer height you select is
20% smaller than your nozzle diameter. For example, if you have a 0.4mm nozzle,
you can’t go too far past a layer height of 0.32mm, or each layer of plastic will not
be able to properly bond to the layer beneath it. So if you notice that your prints
are separating and the layers are not sticking together, the first thing you should
check is your layer height compared to the size of your nozzle. Try reducing the
layer height to see if it helps the layers bond together better. You can do this by
clicking “Basic” and setting “Layer height” in Cura. Please read “Cura Tutorial” to
learn more.


---


## Page 38


33
9.2 Print temperature is too low
Warm plastic will always bond together much better than cold plastic. If you
notice that your layers aren’t bonding together and you are certain that your
layer height isn’t too large, it is possible that your filament needs to be printed a
higher temperature to create a strong bond. For example, if you tried to print
ABS plastic at 190℃, you would likely find that the layers of your part will easily
break apart. This is because ABS typically needs to be printed around 220-
240℃to create a strong bond between the layers of your print. So if you feel this
may be the problem, verify that you are using the correct temperature for the
filament you have purchased. Try increasing the temperature by 5- 10 degrees
to see if the adhesion improves. Please read “Cure Tutorial” or “3D printer
Control Panel Instructions” to learn how to set print temperature.


---


## Page 39


34

10. Grinding Filament
Most 3D printers use a small drive gear that grabs the filament and
sandwiches it against another bearing. The drive gear has sharp teeth that allow
it to bite into the filament and push it forward or backward, depending on which


---


## Page 40


35
direction the drive gear spins. If the filament is unable to move, yet the drive gear
keeps spinning, it can grind away enough plastic from the filament so that there
is nothing left for the gear teeth to grab on to. Many people refer to this situation
as the filament being “stripped,” because too much plastic has been stripped
away for the extruder to function correctly. If this is happening on your printer, you
will typically see lots of small plastic shavings from the plastic that has been
ground away. You may also notice that the extruder motor is spinning, but the
filament is not being pulled into the extruder body. We will explain the easiest way
to resolve this issue below.
10.1 Increase the extruder temperature
If you continue to encounter filament grinding, try to increase the extruder
temperature by 5-10 degrees so that the plastic flows easier. Please read “Cure
Tutorial” or “3D printer Control Panel Instructions” to learn how to set extruder
temperature. Plastic will always flow easier at a higher temperature, so this can
be a very helpful setting to adjust.
10.2 Print too fast
If you continue to encounter filament grinding, even after increasing the
temperature, then the next thing you should do is decrease the printing speed.
By doing this, the extruder motor will not need to spin as fast, since the filament
is extruded over a longer period of time. The slower rotation of the extruder motor


---


## Page 41


36
can help avoid grinding issues. In 3D control panel, you can press the knob to
enter the menu and choose “Configuration” and then choose “motion”,
find“Esteps/mm” to adjust extrusion speed. The default value is 95mm/s. you
modify it to 93mm/s. That means it will be 2mm plastic less extruded from the
nozzle per second. Decrease only a little once to avoid Not Extruding Enough
Plastic and then see if the filament grinding goes away.
10.3 Check for a nozzle clog
If you are still encountering filament grinding after increasing the temperature
and slowing down the print speed, then it’s likely your nozzle is partially clogged.
Please read the Clogged Extruder section for instructions on how to troubleshoot
this issue.


---


## Page 42


37

11. Clogged Extruder
Your 3D printer must melt and extrude many kilograms of plastic over its
lifetime. To make things more complicated, all of this plastic must exit the extruder
through a tiny hole that is only as big as a single grain of sand.


---


## Page 43


38
Inevitably, there may come a time where something goes wrong with this process
and the extruder is no longer able to push plastic through the nozzle. These jams
or clogs are usually due to something inside the nozzle that is blocking the plastic
from freely extruding. While this may be daunting the first time it happens, but we
will walk through several easy troubleshooting steps that can be used to fix a
jammed nozzle.
11.1 Manually push the filament to extruder
One of the first things you may need to try is manually pushing the filament
into the extruder. Open 3D’s Control Panel and heat your extruder to the
appropriate temperature for your plastic. Next, use the Control knob to extruder
a small amount of plastic, for example, 10mm. Please refer to “Tutorial of filament
drawing out and push in”. As the extruder motor is spinning, lightly use your
hands to help push the filament into the extruder. In many cases, this added force
will be enough to advance the filament past the problem area.
11.2 Reload the filament
If the filament still doesn’t move, the next thing you should do is unload the
filament. Verify that the extruder is heated to the appropriate temperature, then
push the filament into extruder and draw it out quickly. As before, you may need
to apply some additional force if the filament isn’t moving. Once the filament is
removed, use a pair of scissors to cut away the melted or damaged portion of the


---


## Page 44


39
filament. Then reload the filament and see if you are able to extrude with the new,
undamaged section of filament. Please refer to “Tutorial of filament drawing out
and push in”.
11.3 Clean out the nozzle
If you can’t extrude the new section of plastic through the nozzle, then it’s
likely you will need to clean out the nozzle before proceeding. Many users have
had success heating their extruder to 200℃ and then manually pulling the filament
out (hopefully along with any debris that was inside). You can use relative
diameter drill (or relative diameter copper line of electric wire) to unclog extruders
by feeding it into the nozzle tip. There are plenty of other methods and each
extruder is different, so please consult your printer manufacturer for precise
instructions.

12. Stops Extruding in the Middle of a Print
If your printer was extruding properly at the beginning of your print, but
suddenly stopped extruding later on, there are typically only a few things that
could have caused this problem. We will explain each common cause below and
provide suggestions for fixing the issue. If your printer was having trouble


---


## Page 46


41
extruding at the very beginning of the print, please see the Not Extruding at Start
of Print section.
12.1 Out of filament
This one is pretty obvious, but before checking the other issues, first verify
that you still have filament leading into the nozzle. If the spool has run out, you
will need to load a new spool before continuing the print.
12.2 The filament has stripped against the drive gear
During a print, the extruder motor is constantly spinning trying to push the
filament into the nozzle so that your printer can keep extruding plastic. If you try
to print too quickly or you try to extrude too much plastic, this motor may end up
grinding away the filament until there is nothing left for the drive gear to grab onto.
If your extruder motor is spinning, but the filament is not moving, then this is likely
the cause. Please see the Grinding Filament section for more details on how to
resolve the issue.
12.3 The extruder is clogged
If none of the above causes apply to you, then it is very likely that the extruder
is clogged. If this happens in the middle of the print, you may want to check and
make sure that the filament is clean and that there is no dust on the spool. If


---


## Page 47


42
enough dust is attached to the filament, it can cause a clog as it builds up inside
the nozzle. There are several other possible causes for a clogged extruder, so
please see the clogged extruder description in the Not Extruding at
Start of Print section for more details.
12.4 Overheated extruder motor driver
The extruder motor has to work incredibly hard during your print. It is constantly
spinning back and forth, pushing and pulling plastic back and forth.
This quick motion requires quite a bit of current, and if the printer’s electronics do
not have sufficient cooling, it can cause the motor driver electronics to overheat.
These motor drivers typically have a thermal cutoff that will cause the driver to
stop working if the temperature gets too high. If this happens, the X and Y axis
motors will be spinning and moving the extruder nozzle, but the extruder motor
will not be moving at all. 3D printer includes a cooling fan to cool down
temperature for the extruder motor. You can also turn off the printer and allow the
electronics to cool down.

13. Weak Infill
The infill inside your 3D printed part plays a very important role in the overall
strength of your model. The infill is responsible for connecting the outer shells of
your 3D print, and must also support upper surfaces that will be printed on top of


---


## Page 49


44
the infill. If your infill appears to be weak or stringy, you may want to adjust a few
settings within the software to add additional strength to this section of your print.
13.1 Increase infill density
In printing process, the fill density print has a great influence to its strength.
If the infill density is very low, there will be a large number of empty gaps in the
interior. Increase infill density appropriately can make print more firmly.
13.2 Lower print speed
The infill is typically printed faster than any other portion of your 3D print. If
you try to print the infill too fast, the extruder won’t be able to keep up and you
will start to notice under-extrusion on the inside of your part. This underextrusion
will tend to create weak, stringy infill since the nozzle is not able to extrude as
much plastic as the software would like. If you have tried several infill patterns,
but continue to have problems with weak infill, try reducing the print speed. To do
this, click “Advanced” and select the Speed.
Adjust the “Infill speed”, which directly controls the speed that is used for the infill.
For example, if you were previously printing at 60mm/s, try decreasing that value
by 50% to see if the infill starts to become stronger and more solid.


---


## Page 50


45

14. Curling or Rough Corners
If you are seeing curling issues later on in your print, it typically points to
overheating issues. The plastic is extruded at a very hot temperature, and if it
does not cool quickly, it may change shape over time. Curling can be prevented


---


## Page 51


46
by rapidly cooling each layer so that it does not have time to deform before it has
solidified. Please read the Overheating section for a more detailed description of
this issue and how to resolve it. If you are noticing the curling at the very
beginning of your print, please see the Print Not Sticking to the Bed section to
address first layer issues.


---


## Page 52


47
15. Scars on Top Surface
One of the benefits of 3D printing is that each part is constructed one layer
at a time. This means that for each individual layer, the nozzle can freely move
to any portion of your print bed, since the part is still being constructed down
below. While this provides for very fast printing times, you may notice that the
nozzle leaves a mark when it travels on top of a previously printed layer. This is
typically most visible on the top solid layers of your part. These scars and marks
occur when the nozzle tries to move to a new location, but ends up dragging
across previously printed plastic. The section below will explore several possible
causes for this and provide recommendations for what settings can be adjusted
to prevent it from happening.
15.1 Extruding too much plastic
One of the first things you should verify is that you are not extruding too much
plastic. If you extrude too much plastic, each layer will tend to be slightly thicker
than intended. This means that when the nozzle tries to move across each layer,
it may drag through some of the excess plastic. Before you look at any other
settings, you should make sure that you are not extruding too much plastic.
Please read the Extruding Too Much Plastic section for more details.

16. Holes and Gaps in Floor Corners
When building 3D printed part, each layer relies on the foundation from the
layer below. However, the amount of plastic that is used for the print is also a
concern, so a balance must be achieved between the strength of the foundation
and the amount of plastic that is used. If the foundation is not strong enough, you


---


## Page 54


49
will start to see holes and gaps between the layers. This is typically most obvious
in the corners, where the size of the part is changing (for example, if you were
printing a 20mm cube on top of a 40mm cube). When you transition to the smaller
size, you need to make sure that you have a sufficient foundation to support the
sidewalls of the 20mm cube. There are several typical causes for these weak
foundations. We will discuss each one below and present the settings that can
be used in Cura to improve the print.
16.1 Not enough perimeters
Adding more outline perimeters to your part will greatly improve the strength
of the foundation. Because the interior of your part is typically partially hollow, the
thickness of the perimeter walls has a significant effect. To adjust this setting,
click “Basic” and click on the “Shell thickness” to set the value.. For example, if
you were previously printing with 0.6mm perimeters, try the same print with
1.2mmperimeters to see if the gaps disappear.
16.2 Not enough top solid layers
Another common cause for a weak foundation is not having enough solid
layers for the top surfaces of your print. A thin ceiling will not be able to adequately
support the structures that are printed on top of them. This setting can be
adjusted by clicking “Basic” and selecting the “Bottom/Top thickness” to set


---


## Page 55


50
appropriate value. If you were previously using only 0.6mm solid layers, try the
same print with 1.2mm top solid layers to see if the foundation is improved.
16.3 Infill density is too low
The final setting you should check is the infill density. You will set the value
under  the“Fill Density” tab of  “Basic”. The top solid layers will be built on top of
the infill, so it is important that there is enough infill to support these layers. For
example, if you were previously using a infill percentage of 20%, try increasing
that value to 40% to see if the print quality improves.


---


## Page 56


51

17. Lines on the Side of Print
The sides of your 3D printed part are composed of hundreds of individual layers.
If things are working properly, these layers will appear to be a single, smooth surface.


---


## Page 57


52
However, if something goes wrong with just one of these layers, it is usually clearly
visible from the outside of the print. These improper layers may appear to look like
lines or ridges on the sides of your part. Many times the defects will appear to be
cyclical, meaning that the lines appear in a repeating pattern (i.e. once every 15
layers). The section below will look at several common causes for these issues.
17.1 Inconsistent extrusion
The most common cause for this issue is poor filament quality. If the
filament does not have very tight tolerances, then you will notice this variation on
the side walls of your print. For example, if your filament diameter varied by just
5% over the length of the spool, the width of the plastic extruded from the nozzle
could change by as much as 0.05mm. This extra extrusion will create a layer that
is wider than all the others, which will end up looking like a line on the side of the
print. To create a perfectly smooth side wall, your printer needs to be able to
produce a very consistent extrusion which requires high-quality plastic.
17.2 Temperature variation
Most 3D printers use a thermistor to regulate the temperature of the extruder.
If this thermistor is not tuned properly, the temperature of the extruder may
fluctuate over time. Due to the nature of how thermistor works, this fluctuation is
frequently cyclical, meaning that the temperature will vary with a sine wave
pattern. As the temperature gets hotter, the plastic may flow differently than when
it is cooler. This will cause the layers of the print to extrude differently, creating


---


## Page 58


53
visible ridges on the sides of your print. A properly tuned printer should be able
to maintain the extruder temperature within
+/-3degrees. During your print, you can use 3D printer’s control panel to monitor the
temperature of your extruder. If it is varying by more than 3 degrees, you may need
to recalibrate your thermistor. Please consult your printer manufacturer for exact
instructions on how to do this.
17.3 Mechanical issues
If you know that inconsistent extrusion and temperature variation are not to
blame, then there may be a mechanical issue that is causing lines and ridges on
the sides of your print. For example, if the print bed wobbles or vibrates while
printing, this can cause the nozzle position to vary. This means that some layers
may be slightly thicker than others. These thicker layers will produce ridges on
the sides of your print. Another common issue is a Z-axis threaded rod that is not
being positioned properly. For example, due to backlash issues or poor motor
controller micro-stepping settings. Even a small change in the bed position can
have a major impact on the quality of each layer that is printed.


---


## Page 59

18. Vibrations and Ringing
Ringing is a wavy pattern that may appear on the surface of your print due
to printer vibrations or wobbling. Typically, you will notice this pattern when the
extruder is making a sudden direction change, such as near a sharp corner. For


---


## Page 60


55
example, if you were printing a 20mm cube, each time the extruder changes to
print a different face of the cube, it would need to change directions. The inertia
of the extruder can create vibrations when these sudden direction changes occur,
which will be visible of the print itself. We will look at the most common ways to
address ringing, by examining each cause in the list below.
18.1 Print too fast
The most common cause for ringing is that your printer is trying to move too
fast. When the printer suddenly changes direction, these quick movements will
create additional force that can cause the lingering vibrations. If you feel that your
printer may be moving too fast, try to reduce the printing speed. To do this, click
“Basic” and select the“Print speed” tab to set suitable value.
18.2 Firmware acceleration
The firmware that runs on your 3D printer’s electronics typically implements
acceleration controls to help prevent sudden direction changes. The acceleration
settings will cause the printer to slowly ramp up in speed and then to slowly
decelerate before changing directions. This functionality is vital for preventing
ringing. If you are comfortable working with your printer’s firmware, you may even
want to try decreasing the acceleration settings so that the speed changes more
gradually. This can help reduce ringing even further.


---


## Page 61


56
18.3 Mechanical issues
If nothing else has been able to resolving the ringing issues, then you may
want to look for mechanical issues that could be causing the excessive vibrations.
For example, there could be a loose screw or a broken bracket that is allowing
excessive vibrations to occur. Watch your printer closely while it is running and
try to identify where the vibrations are coming from. We’ve had many users that
eventually traced these issues back to mechanical problems with the printer, so
it’s worth checking if none of the suggestions above were able to help.


---


## Page 62


57

19. Very Small Features Not Being Printed
Your printer includes a nozzle with a fixed size that allows you to accurately
reproduce very small features. For example, many printers include a nozzle with a
0.4mm diameter hole in the tip. While this works well for most parts, you may start to


---


## Page 63


58
encounter issues when trying to print extremely thin features that are smaller than
the nozzle diameter. For example, if you were trying to print a 0.2mm thick wall with
a 0.4mm nozzle. The reason for this is that you cannot accurately produce a 0.2mm
extrusion from a 0.4mm nozzle.
The extrusion width should always be equal to or greater than the nozzle diameter.
Because of this, when you click “Layers” in Cura, you may notice that the software
removes these small features from the preview. This is the software’s way of telling
you that you cannot print these very tiny features using the current nozzle on your
3D printer. If you are frequently printing very small parts, this may be a recurring
issue that you encounter. There are several options that will allow you to
successfully print these small parts. We will example each one in the section below.
19.1 Redesign the parts with thicker features
The first and most obvious option is to redesign the part so that it only
includes features that are larger than your nozzle diameter. This typically involves
editing the 3D model in the original CAD package to modify the size of the small
features. Once you have thickened the small features, you can reimport the
model into Cura to verify that your printer is capable of reproducing the 3D shape
you created. If the features are visible in the Layers, then the printer will be
capable of reproducing the revised features.
19.2 Install a nozzle with a smaller tip size
In many cases, you are not able to modify the original 3D model. For example,
it may be a part that someone else designed or one that you downloaded from


---


## Page 64


59
the internet. In this case, you may want to consider obtaining a second nozzle for
your 3D printer that allows it to print smaller features. Many printers have a
removable nozzle tip, which makes these aftermarket adjustments quite easy.
For example, many users purchase a 0.3mm nozzle as well as a 0.5mm nozzle
to provide two options. Consult your printer manufacturer for exact instructions
on how to install a smaller nozzle tip size.
19.3 Force the software to print small features
If you are not able to redesign the original 3D model, and you can’t install
a smaller nozzle on your 3D printer, then you have one last option. You can force
the software to print these small features. However, it is likely that this may have
some print quality consequences. If you click on “Advanced” and go to the Nozzle
size tab, you can manually set the extrusion width that the software should use
for your printer. For example, if you have a 0.4mm nozzle, you could select a
manual extrusion width of 0.3mm to force the software to print features as small
as 0.3mm in size. However, as we mentioned above, most nozzles are not
capable of accurately producing an extrusion that is smaller than the tip size, so
monitor your printer closely to ensure that the quality is acceptable for these fine
features.


---


## Page 65


60

20. Inconsistent Extrusion
For your printer to be able to create accurate parts, it needs to be capable of
extruding a very consistent amount of plastic. If this extrusion varies across
different parts of your print, it is going to affect the final print quality. Inconsistent
extrusion can usually be identified by watching your printer closely as it prints.


---


## Page 66


61
For example, if the printer is printing a straight line that is 20mm long, but you
notice that the extrusion seems rather bumpy or seems to vary in size, then you
are likely experiencing this issue. We have summarized the most common
causes for inconsistent extrusion, and explained how each one can be addressed.
20.1 Filament is getting stuck or tangled
The first thing you should check is the spool of plastic that is feeding into
your printer. You need to make sure that this spool is able to rotate freely and that
the plastic is easily being unwound from the spool. If the filament becomes
tangled, or the spool has too much resistance to spin freely, it will impact how
evenly the filament is extruded through the nozzle.
20.2 Clogged extruder
If the filament is not tangled and can easily be pushed into the extruder, then
the next thing to check is the nozzle itself. It is possible that there is some small
debris or foreign plastic inside the nozzle that is preventing proper extrusion. An
easy way to check this is to use3D printer’s control panel to manually extrude
some plastic from the nozzle. Watch to make sure that the plastic is extruding
evenly and consistently. If you notice problems, you may need to clean the nozzle.
Please consult your manufacturer for instructions on how to properly clean the
inside of the nozzle.


---


## Page 67


62
20.3 Layer height is very low
If the filament is spinning freely and the extruder is not clogged, it may be
useful to check a few settings within Cura. For example, if you are trying to print
at an extremely low layer height, such as 0.01mm, there is very little room for the
plastic to exit the nozzle. This gap below the nozzle is only 0.01mm tall, which
means that the plastic may have a difficult time exiting the extruder. Double check
to make sure you are using a reasonable layer height for your printer. You can
view this setting by clicking “Basic” and selecting the Layer height tab. If you are
printing at a very small layer height, try increasing the value to see if the problem
goes away.
20.4 Poor quality filament
One of the most common causes for inconstant extrusion that we have not
mentioned yet is the quality of the filament that you are printing with. Low quality
filament may contain extra additives that impact the consistency of the plastic.
Others may have an inconsistent filament diameter, which will also cause
inconsistent extrusion. Finally, many plastics also have a tendency to degrade
over time. For example, PLA tends to absorb moisture from the air, and over time,
this will cause the print quality to degrade. This is why many spools of plastic
include a desiccant in the package to help remove any moisture from the spool.
If you think your filament may be at fault, try swapping the spool for a new,
unopened, high-quality spool to see if the problem goes away.


---


## Page 68


63
20.5 Mechanical issues of extruder
If you have verified everything above and are still having problems with
inconsistent extrusion, then you may want to check for mechanical issues with
your extruder. For example, many extruders use a drive gear with sharp teeth
that bite into the filament. This allows the extruder to move the filament back and
forth easily. These extruders also typically include an adjustment that changes
how hard the drive gear is pressed into the filament. If this setting is too loose,
the drive gear teeth won’t cut far enough into the filament, which impacts the
extruder’s ability to accurately control the position of the filament.
Consult  to see if your printer has a similar adjustment.
