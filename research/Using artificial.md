INTRODUCTION
3D printing technology – particularly meth­
ods such as fused filament fabrication (FFF) and
fused deposition modeling (FDM) – has become
increasingly popular in both industrial and home
applications. A crucial element of the 3D print­
ing process is the preparation of input files for the
printer – so-called g-code files – which contain all
the information necessary for the correct execu­
tion of the print. These files control and command
the movements of the actuators responsible for
nozzle positioning over the build area in the XYZ
axes, the speed of the extruder mechanism, noz­
zle and bed temperatures, as well as many other
critical printing parameters.
Traditional methods of generating g-code, im­
plemented in so-called slicers, rely on determinis­
tic algorithms that do not always lead to optimal
results in terms of print quality [1, 2], build time,
or material consumption [3, 4]. An interesting
study is presented in [1], where the dimensional
accuracy of a test part – compliant with the ISO
16792:2021-04 standard – was evaluated. The

ABSTRACT
3D printing technology – particularly thermoplastic-based methods such as fused filament fabrication (FFF) and
fused deposition modeling (FDM) – has gained popularity in both industrial and home settings. A key element
of the 3D-printing process is the preparation of the printer’s batch files – so-called g-code files – which contain
all the information needed for correct execution of the print. Traditional methods of generating g-code rely on
deterministic algorithms that do not always yield optimal results in terms of print quality (dimensional accuracy
of the geometry), build time, material consumption, and functional parameters such as the mechanical strength of
the printed part. In recent years, interest has grown in using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize these processes.
AI algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning, have the potential to analyse and optimize g-code
in ways that surpass traditional approaches, offering higher print quality, greater energy efficiency, and shorter
production times. This work explores the modification of print parameters recorded in g-code files through the
use of AI, demonstrating that the modified files produce prints with improved mechanical strength. A large lan­
guage model (ChatGPT-4o) was used to selectively modify nozzle temperature parameters in g-code files, based
on prompt engineering and filament datasheets. Tensile samples made from Easy PLA and Easy PET-G filaments
were printed and tested in three-point bending, in accordance with ISO 14125. The samples were divided into
three groups: unmodified (reference), modified every 2 layers, and modified every 3 layers. The results showed an
increase in the average breaking force for PLA samples by 2.7% and 3.0%, and for PET-G samples by 4.3% and
9.9%, respectively. Comparative analysis of the g-code files confirmed that the AI introduced cyclic temperature
changes (increase in M104 commands from 3 to 30), improving interlayer adhesion. The flexural strength im­
provements were consistent with these modifications. In conclusion, AI-driven g-code optimization offers a simple
and effective way to improve the mechanical properties of printed objects without altering geometry or increasing
material usage. This approach holds great potential for advancing additive manufacturing processes, particularly
in the context of Industry 4.0.

dimensional fidelity of prints created using FDM,
SLA, and SLS methods was compared against
the original CAD model. In [2], the influence of
printing speed on the surface quality of printed
components was investigated. Other studies focus
on the mechanical properties of prints depending
on infill pattern [5], material type [6], nozzle di­
ameter [5], or the temperature distribution within
the printing zone [7].
In recent years, interest in the application of
artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize these pro­
cesses has grown significantly. AI algorithms, in­
cluding machine learning and deep learning, have
the potential to analyze and optimize g-code files
in ways that surpass traditional approaches, offer­
ing improved print quality, enhanced energy effi­
ciency, and reduced production time [8], [9], [10].
3D printing technology
The origins of 3D printing technology date
back to the 1980s, when Charles Hull began work
on this manufacturing method for the purpose of
rapid prototyping [11]. A key milestone in the de­
velopment of 3D printing was the creation of the
STL file format (STereoLithography or Standard
Tessellation Language) in 1983, which enabled
communication between the 3D printer and the
digital model. The first 3D printer was developed
by Charles Hull and 3D Systems, and was named
the Stereolithography Apparatus (SLA). The first
commercial solution, called SLA 250, was intro­
duced in 1988 [11].
In 1990, the FDM technique was developed
by Scott Crump, and the first patent application
for 3D printing technology was filed in 1993. In
recent years, 3D printing technology has expe­
rienced rapid growth, with numerous compa­
nies entering the market to develop increasingly
advanced, reliable, and functional devices, as
well as materials used in the printing process.
Additive manufacturing technologies currently
developed and implemented can be divided into
three main groups:
	•
Printing with thermoplastic filaments, shaped
into strands of a specified diameter, which are
fed into a print head that melts and deposits
the material layer by layer. This group in­
cludes FFF/FDM methods.
	•
Printing with photosensitive resins, which
are locally cured by a light source. The light
source may be a laser beam (SLA), a projector
lamp (DLP), or an LED array (LED method).
	•
Printing with powdered materials, including
CJP (gypsum), SLS (plastics), and SLM (met­
al powders).
All 3D printing methods require proper prepa­
ration of digital models. The complete cycle from
idea to finished 3D-printed object is illustrated
in Figure 1. In the classical approach, a virtual
model is obtained either through CAD software
modeling or by using one of the methods applied
in reverse engineering (such as 3D scanning, pho­
togrammetry, coordinate measuring machines,
etc.). Once the model is created, it is exported to
a standard STL file, which is then processed in a
slicer. The end result is a generated g-code file
(for FFF/FDM technology), which is interpreted
by the printer’s processor to execute movements
along the respective axes.
The diversity of 3D printing methods has
made this technology – originally classified as a
rapid prototyping method – widely applicable not
only in engineering but also in scientific research,
art, and education. Examples of engineering ap­
plications include the fabrication of complex ge­
ometric shapes for planar and spatial electronics
solutions [12], or the printing of blades for small
wind turbines [13]. An example of such additive
technology applications in other fields is bioprint­
ing in medicine [14]. Ferro et al. [15] are work­
ing on new structures made using SLM (selective
laser melting) technology for anti-icing solutions

in aluminum. It is worth noting the emergence
of studies on 4D printing [16], which involves
materials that respond to external stimuli. Junk
and colleagues have explored the possibility of
printing grippers for specialized applications, in
which the gripper closes as a result of tempera­
ture increase. Another branch of additive method
development is the introduction of new types of
materials. For instance, Kotorčević et al. [17] ex­
amined the use of PLA filament doped with cop­
per for water filtration systems. Kujawa et al. [18]
investigated the improvement of tribological and
strength properties of PLA material doped with
MoC2. They demonstrated an improvement in
the quality of printed objects and an improvement
in their resistance to external loads. Zubrzycki
et al. [19] investigated the influence of printing
parameters (layer height, temperature and print­
ing speed) on the mechanical strength of samples
made of ABS, PLA and PET-G materials.
To summarize, in every described case and
development direction of additive manufacturing
methods, users aim for the final printed part to
be as accurate as possible compared to the CAD
model - ensuring dimensional fidelity [1], mini­
mizing print time, and maximizing the mechanical
properties of the printed part, as achievable with
the input material. These criteria often conflict
with each other. For example, increasing the print
speed (to reduce print time) increases vibrations
in the printer, which can degrade print quality [2].
Meeting all of these criteria simultaneously
is challenging, but continuous improvements are
being explored. One such effort is the study by
Liu et al. [20], in which the traveling salesman
optimization method was used to reduce idle noz­
zle movements (i.e., non-extruding travel), there­
by minimizing stringing effects that negatively
affect print quality. On the other hand, Jadayel
and Khameneifar [21] focused on improving print
quality by modifying the STL file based on scans
of a test print, without altering the g-code itself.
Artifical intelligence
Modern technological advancement is in­
creasingly focused on implementing the principles
of Industry 4.0. One of the most transformative
tools in this context is artificial intelligence (AI),
which is revolutionizing industrial processes [22].
AI offers a wide range of capabilities depending
on how the neural network is designed by the pro­
grammer. It can, for example, predict undesirable
events through real-time data monitoring using
purpose-specific sensors. This can involve statisti­
cal analysis or image detection and interpretation.
Beyond monitoring and diagnostics, AI sys­
tems are capable of autonomous decision-making
and initiating appropriate procedures in response
to various situations. The most commonly used
methods for such purposes include linear regres­
sion and decision trees. This reduces the level of
human intervention in industrial processes, shift­
ing the human role from primary operator to over­
seer, thereby minimizing human error. However,
such applications require specialized knowledge
in AI programming – typically using Python and
libraries such as Keras, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
Thanks to the development of large language
models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copi­
lot, even users with limited programming experi­
ence can now create specialized tools. This is done
through the crafting of well-designed “prompts”
– commands or instructions that guide the AI to
carry out specific tasks. AI has also found its way
into 3D printing, especially in areas related to ma­
chine learning for process diagnostics and moni­
toring. With properly trained algorithms, a 3D
printer can autonomously detect issues such as:
	•
print detachment from the bed,
	•
stringing defects,
	•
inadequate nozzle temperature leading to in­
consistent filament flow,
	•
clogged nozzles resulting in filament feed
failure,
	•
filament depletion.
These issues can be detected using image
analysis, which requires the integration of a
camera with the printer to enable real-time im­
age processing. Some companies have already
implemented such solutions. For instance, Bam­
bulab offers high-end printers that operate auton­
omously without requiring user intervention in
the control system. In contrast, printers like the
Ender 3 V3 Plus by Creality provide similar print
speeds and quality, but integrating AI into these
machines requires purchasing a compatible cam­
era and having basic technical skills.
Creating an AI-based print monitoring and
diagnostic system is possible for nearly any
3D printer equipped with a network interface.
A Raspberry Pi microcontroller can be used
to host a VPN server and process image data,
though success may be limited by factors such
as network latency, interruptions, or whether the

microcontroller’s processor can handle AI algo­
rithms, real-time image processing, and remote
server operation simultaneously.
AI in 3D printing can be applied as early as
the prototyping stage. Since the actual printing
process is the final step in additive manufactur­
ing, generative modeling offers an opportunity to
design parts with optimized geometries that are
difficult to achieve using traditional modeling
methods – while still meeting mechanical strength
requirements. This can reduce material use with­
out compromising performance. In such cases,
the user first creates a base shape, after which AI
performs the optimization process.
This article also explores repeating the AI-as­
sisted optimization at the next stage: converting
the STL file to g-code. Since g-code is a sequence
of machine instructions and functions as a pro­
gramming language, it can be analyzed and modi­
fied like any other code – even by large language
models like successive versions of ChatGPT.
This practice is becoming increasingly common
among both beginner and advanced developers.
This trend raises concerns about the potential
impact on the job market, particularly for program­
mers who may be partially replaced by AI. The
phenomenon – known as “prompt engineering” –
is rapidly gaining traction and reshaping various
long-standing professions. One could argue we
are witnessing yet another industrial revolution.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has even stated
publicly that English is becoming one of the new
programming languages – alongside Python, C,
C#, C++, Java, and others [23]. While this was un­
thinkable until recently, the translation of human
thought into code capable of generating or modi­
fying professional-grade software is now increas­
ingly achievable with each advancement in LLMs.
Advanced engineering software like MAT­
LAB already supports custom script execution
for analysis, simulation, and control across many
technical fields. Large language models such as
ChatGPT now have the capability to generate
such scripts. Moreover, even if it’s not yet possi­
ble to directly create a Simulink file (block-based
graphical programming), AI can generate MAT­
LAB scripts that, when run, build the desired
block sequence programmatically.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Among the many filaments available on the
market, two widely used and readily accessible
types were selected: Easy PLA [24] and Easy PET-
G [25], both manufactured by Fiberlogy. For each
of these filaments, the manufacturer provides es­
sential printing parameters (such as temperature
and mechanical), which are summarized in Table 1.
Slicing computer program
The samples for comparative testing were
modeled in the Autodesk Fusion 360 environment.
The resulting STL models were then sliced using
Cura – a popular, free, and open-source software
widely used by additive manufacturing enthusi­
asts. Cura enables the generation of g-code files
for printers operating with FFF/FDM technology.
Cura offers more than 400 customizable set­
tings, allowing for precise control over various
aspects of the 3D model before printing. These in­
clude parameters such as layer height, infill, sup­
ports, wall thickness, cooling settings, and many
others. The software integrates seamlessly with
numerous popular CAD programs (e.g., Solid­
Works, Autodesk Inventor), facilitating a smooth
transition from design to print. Importantly, Cura
is compatible with a wide range of file formats,
including STL, OBJ, X3D, 3MF, BMP, GIF, JPG,
and PNG. Another key advantage is its ability to
import material profiles from leading filament
manufacturers, streamlining the process of setting
optimal print parameters.

POINT BENDING STATION
The configuration of the measurement setup for
testing the samples is shown in Figure 2. The com­
ponents are labelled with the following numbers:
1.	NEMA 57BYGH76 280 4a 4.25g stepper mo­
tor with a 4.25:1 gear ratio,
2.	DM860H stepper motor driver,
3.	Raspberry Pi 4,
4.	HDMI LCD display,
5.	Mechanism for converting rotary motion to

6.	Manson NTP-5531 laboratory power supply,
7.	Computer for data acquisition,
8.	Arduino Uno R3,
9.	SparkFun load cell amplifier,
10.	Test sample compliant with ISO 14125,
11.	NA27 strain gauge load cells.
To enable measurements on the constructed
test stand, it is necessary to determine the quan­
tities that allow for identifying the displacement
of the element applying pressure to the samples.
The analysis began by calculating the relationship
between the number of motor steps, the gear ratio,
and the lead screw pitch. The number of steps per
rotation was calculated using Equation 1:

𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠=
360°
𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎=
360°
1.8° = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠/𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 	 (1)
where:	angstep = 1.80° – step angle of the NEMA
57BYGH76 stepper motor.
The displacement of the carriage ∆x per one
step of the stepper motor is calculated using
Equation 2:

∆𝑥𝑥=
𝑃𝑃
𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠 × 𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑛𝑛
(2)
where:	P = 8 mm – lead of the TR8 trapezoidal
screw, i = 4.25 – gear ratio.
After substituting the values, we obtain the
displacement △x = 0.0094 mm. The step constant
was set in the motor driver to △t = 0.005 s, which
means the motor performs 200 steps per second
(1 full rotation), resulting in the screw moving
200 · △x = 200·0.0094 = 1.88 mm/s. A key com­
ponent enabling the determination of the fracture
forces of the samples is the strain gauge beams
used in the test stand. The basic parameters of the
strain gauge beams are presented in Table 2.
In the case of the considered tests, the load­
ing of the beams and the force measurement are
performed in only one direction (Figure 3a).
Hysteresis error becomes significant in measure­
ments where the deformation of the beams and
the readings would be carried out bidirectionally
(Figure 3b).
The repeatability coefficient was verified by
repeatedly performing measurements involving
Figure 2. Station for testing the strength of printed samples

an increase in the applied force followed by its
return to a value close to 0 N. This approach al­
lows for demonstrating the accuracy with which
the force increases as a function of the sample’s
displacement. The results of the recorded meas­
urements for both increasing and decreasing
force values are presented in Figure 4. The area
corresponding to force increase, marked with a
frame, represents the sample fracture experiment
(Figure 3).
Subsequently, the Type A uncertainty was
determined (this type of uncertainty is calculat­
ed based on measurements).To determine it, the
arithmetic mean of the performed measurements
must be calculated according to the following
formula:
	𝑥𝑁𝑠𝑖
𝑥𝑥̅ =
1
𝑛𝑛∑
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
 𝑠
(3)
where:	n = 4 – number of trials, xᵢ – value of the
measurement in the i-th trial.
Based on the arithmetic mean (Eq. (3)), the
standard deviation is calculated as follows [26]:
	𝑥𝑛𝑛𝑥𝑖𝑖
𝑠𝑠= √
1
𝑛𝑛(𝑛𝑛−1) ∑
(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅)2
𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
 𝑢𝐴𝑠
(4)
Finally, the Type A uncertainty (standard un­
certainty of the mean) is calculated using Equa­
tion 5:
	𝑠𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛
𝑢𝑢𝐴𝐴=
𝑠𝑠
√𝑛𝑛

trial) is presented in Table 3.
Based on the 4 conducted trials, in which 68
measurements were recorded for each trial within
the force increase range up to a maximum of 112
N (see Figure 4), the Type A measurement uncer­
tainty and its mean value were estimated. The re­
sults are presented in Figure 5.
Samples for testing
For the testing of reference samples (un­
modified by the AI algorithm) and modified
samples, test stands for three-point bending
tests were used in accordance with ISO 14125.
According to this standard, the samples should
have dimensions of L = 80 mm, b = 10 mm, and
h = 4 mm. The standard also allows for samples
with other dimensions. The shape of the sample
used for testing is shown in Figure 6.
Basic gcode modified with AI
The proposed modified procedure involves
the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to op­
timize the G-code in order to achieve a noticeable
improvement in a selected parameter of the 3D
printing process. This may include, for example,
an enhancement of the mechanical strength of
the print or an improvement in the printing pro­
cess itself (e.g., shortening the print time without
compromising quality). Figure 1 presents a sche­
matic of the traditional model preparation work­
flow for a 3D printer.
The proposed workflow incorporating AI-
based G-code modification is shown in Figure

The content of the prepared prompt is pre­
sented below.
Creation of a specialized thread in the large
language model Chat GPT-4o (Omni), primar­
ily for advanced tasks that are more technical and
engineering-focused rather than creative [27]. The
content of the prepared prompt is presented be­
low: “Hello, please assume the role of a 3D print­
ing specialist. You specialize in modifying exist­
ing G-code programs. This thread of conversation
concerns the modification of existing G-code. I am
focused on increasing the strength of the prints. I
cannot afford to increase the number of walls or
the infill density or change the infill pattern. I am
attaching the datasheet of my 3D printer and the
datasheet of the filament I plan to use. Please op­
timize the G-code by modifying the speeds and
temperatures used. Apply changes to every second
or third layer in terms of speed and temperature to
achieve the best possible strength results. I will be
asking you to modify the G-code file that I will pro­
vide. Please refer only to scientifically proven op­
timization assumptions and information obtained
through the analysis of the attached datasheets”.
1.	Polite greeting – interestingly, it has been ob­
served that when users of AI language models
politely address the model as a conversation
partner, better results are often achieved. Al­
though this is somewhat concerning, it is un­
derstandable given the immersive nature of the
interaction.
2.	Specialization enforcement – at this point, the
scope of the thread is deliberately limited to a
non-creative context. By instructing the model
to act as a specialist in the relevant discipline,
the user ensures a higher likelihood of receiving
accurate and technically grounded responses.
The GPT-4o model was chosen for this scenario
as it is particularly suited for technical tasks.
3.	Task specification – this is the most crucial part
of the prompt. The language model is given a
specific task along with a clear role definition.
Without such a directive, the model is more
prone to error due to a lack of context and role
awareness.
4.	References and input constraints – another
critical instruction. The language model may
have been trained on data concerning typical
3D printing materials such as PLA, PETG, or
ABS. However, each filament may have dif­
ferent optimal parameters depending on the
manufacturer, properties, or even color. By re­
quiring the model to refer to actual datasheets,
the user ensures that the algorithm bases its
modifications on verified data related to both
the filament and the printer – two key compo­
nents of the FFF/FDM process.
5.	Task refinement – this functions as a reiteration
of the task but with more detail. It specifies the
exact type of modifications the user expects.
Repeating the task (even multiple times) is im­
portant in prompt engineering, as it improves
the model’s “understanding” of the desired
output. Just like neural networks are trained
through layers and input weighting, repeated
instruction functions as additional learning

reinforcement for the thread.
6.	Reiteration of constraints – as mentioned, this
serves as another safeguard layer. It ensures the
creative module is suppressed. While creativity
is beneficial in marketing content, in this tech­
nical context it poses a risk of generating mis­
leading or even hazardous instructions for the
printer. Referring only to scientific, validated
modifications serves as a solid protection mech­
anism in the training of the model’s behavior.
In the described case (Figure 8), traditional
programming languages such as Python are not
used. Instead, a linguistic model is applied by
accurately and consciously formulating specific
commands using natural human language—
moreover, in almost any language. This is par­
ticularly significant as it eliminates limitations
caused by language barriers, creating new oppor­
tunities for programming artificial intelligence
for a much broader audience, not necessarily
English-speaking.
RESULTS
The results of the conducted measurement
experiments are presented in the following sub­
sections in the form of graphs showing the in­
crease in force from the moment the test stand is
activated until the maximum force is reached at
the point of breakage (sample deformation). The
experiments were carried out using samples with
dimensions of 100 × 7.5 × 7.5 mm, which are ap­
proved for testing according to the ISO 14125
standard. A greater sample height of 7.5 mm was
selected (the standard height is 4 mm) to allow for
more print layers, and thus more opportunities to
change the printing parameters. For this chosen
sample shape, three types of specimens were pro­
duced: original ones (without any modification
of the g-code generated in the CURA software),
specimens modified every 2 layers, and speci­
mens modified every 3 layers. The tests were con­
ducted on samples made of Easy PLA [24] and
Easy PET-G [25] from Fiberlogy. These variants
are referred to in the further sections as follows:

Results for samples with a dimension of 100 ×
7.5 × 7.5 mm – Easy PLA material
For these sample dimensions, measurements
were carried out on 10 specimens for each var­
iant. Figure 9 presents the results obtained for
samples printed using unmodified g-codes gen­
erated by slicers (NMP), samples modified every
2 layers (PM2L), and samples modified every 3
layers (PM3L). The values ​for each of the tests
are illustrated in Figure 9 and the maximum val­
ues ​of the breaking force are summarized in Table
4. The cases NMP, PM2L and PM3L presented
in the figure represent the time histories of the
increase in force measured on the tensometric
beams (the places where the samples were sup­
ported – see Figure 2). For each of the cases, 10
tests were performed and summarized in the fig­
ure. The maximum values ​corresponding to the
moment of sample fracture are summarized in

Table 4 and then the average value was calculated
from the 10 maximum values ​(Favg in Table 4).
The increase in the breaking force of the Easy
PLA samples based on AI-modified g-code files
(PM2L) compared to the baseline samples (NMP)
is just under 2.7%. The percentage difference in
breaking force for samples modified every 3 lay­
ers (PM3L) relative to the NMP samples is just
under 3.0%. The time histories of the force in­
crease shown in Figure 9 demonstrate the speci­
ficity of the PLA material. It consists in the fact
that the samples transfer the load exerted in their
central part to the supports until the limit value of
the force is reached and then the samples break,
which is manifested in the histories by a sudden
drop in the force to 0.
Results for samples with a dimension of 100 ×
7.5 × 7.5 mm – Easy PET-G material
For these sample dimensions, measurements
were conducted on 10 specimens for each variant.
Figure 10 presents the results obtained for sam­
ples printed using unmodified g-codes (gener­
ated by slicers – NMP), samples modified every
2 layers (PM2L), and samples modified every 3
layers (PM3L). All samples were made from Easy
PET-G using filament from a single spool. The
values for each of the tests are illustrated in Fig­
ure 10 and the maximum values of the breaking
force are summarized in Table 5. For each of the
cases, 10 tests were performed and summarized in
the figure. The maximum values ​corresponding to
the moment of sample fracture are summarized in
Table 5 and then the average value was calculated
from the 10 maximum values ​(Favg in Table 5).
The increase in the breaking force of the Easy
PET-G samples based on AI-modified g-code files
(PM2L) compared to the baseline samples (NMP)
is just under 4.3%. The percentage difference in
breaking force for samples modified every 3 lay­
ers (PM3L) relative to the NMP samples exceeds
9.9%. The time courses of force increase shown in
Figure 10 show the specificity of the PET-G mate­
rial. It consists in the fact that the samples transfer
the load exerted in their central part to the sup­
ports until the limit value of the force is reached
and then the samples undergo plastic deformation
– which is visible in the part of the course after the
maximum value. The force does not decrease to 0

Figure 11. Temperature values extracted from the g-code files CE3_1.gcode, CE3_2.gcode, and CE3_3.gcode
(the moment of sample fracture) as in the case of
samples made of PLA material. PET-G samples
start to deform but do not break brittle.
G-CODE files for 100 × 7.5 × 7.5 samples
(PM2L) – Easy PLA material, before and after
modification
Printing parameters (nozzle temperature)
were compared – Table 6 and Figure 11. Table 6
lists the key commands saved in the g-code file,
respectively: CE3_1.gcode – file generated by the
CURA slicer, CE3_2.gcode – file generated by the
CURA slicer and modified by ChatGPT-4 in June
2024, and the CE3_3.gcode file – file generated
by the CURA slicer and modified by ChatGPT-4o
after a year in May 2025. As shown in previous
chapters, g-code modifications due to tempera­
ture changes during printing have a measurable
effect on the strength of samples tested using the
three-point bending method. Figure 11 shows the
temperature changes specified in the g-code files
CE3_1.gcode, CE3_2.gcode, and CE3_3.gcode.
CONCLUSIONS
The conducted research demonstrated that the
application of artificial intelligence algorithms
to optimize g-code files used in fused filament
fabrication (FFF/FDM) 3D printing technology
yields measurable benefits in terms of improved
mechanical performance of printed objects.
Modifying g-code files using the ChatGPT-4o
language model led to a 2.7% increase in average
breaking force for Easy PLA samples when tem­
perature was modified every 2 layers, and a 3.0%
increase when modified every 3 layers. Even more
significant improvements were recorded for Easy
PET-G, with a 4.3% increase in average breaking
force for modifications every 2 layers and a 9.9%
increase for every 3 layers.
These results indicate a material-dependent
response to AI-based optimization: Easy PET-G
exhibited nearly 3 times greater strength gain in
the PM3L variant than Easy PLA, likely due to
its wider optimal processing temperature range
(220–250 °C vs. 200–230 °C) and higher thermal
responsiveness. The proposed method, relying on
large language models for g-code modification, is
both technically accessible and effective, requir­
ing only a properly formulated prompt and knowl­
edge of the printer and filament specifications.
Comparative analysis of the g-code files re­
vealed that the AI-generated modifications in­
creased the number of M104 commands (hotend
temperature setting) from 3 in the baseline file to
30, introducing cyclic thermal adjustments that
likely improved interlayer bonding. Additionally,
the number of G1 commands increased slightly
(from 1697 to 1724), indicating minor adjust­
ments to the extrusion path, and F values (fee­
drate commands) were modified (from 2472 to
2499 entries), suggesting targeted optimization of
movement speeds.

This research confirms that AI-assisted g-code
editing can lead to quantifiable improvements in
3D printed part strength without altering geome­
try, increasing material use, or requiring hardware
modifications. The method shows promise for
broader application, particularly within Industry
4.0 paradigms, where automated process optimi­
zation is highly valued.
